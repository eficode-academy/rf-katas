# Keywords and Variables

One of the most powerful things that Robot Framework can do is to provide the capability to write test
cases using natural language. In an ideal world, it is not just people who write those tests, but also
other people are interested in the automated test case results, including how, where, and when they are
run.

This can be made possible by using
[user defined keywords](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-user-keywords)

## User Defined Keywords

With user defined keywords we can create abstraction layers when needed. A general rule of thumb is that
library and resource keywords are "general sounding" ones and keywords in test suite files are more
test context specific.

<details>
    <summary>From previous exercises we should have something like this in our <code>robot/login.robot</code></summary>

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    Browser

*** Test Cases ***

Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login
    New Browser    headless=${FALSE}
    New Page    http://localhost:7272
    Fill Text    id=username_field    demo
    Fill Secret    id=password_field    mode
    Click    id=login_button
    Get Text    body    contains    Welcome Page
    Get Url    ==    http://localhost:7272/welcome.html
    Get Title    ==    Welcome Page
```

</details>

This test is technically correct, but we have travelled quite far from our natural language test steps
we implemented in exercise 01 and it can be quite hard to read if you don't know e.g. what is an HTML
attribute `id`.

In other words, we need to refactor our test a bit.

### Exercise

We need to add a new table `*** Keywords ***`. It can be above or below the `*** Test Cases ***`.

Under the `Keywords` table we need to create a new keyword called `Open Browser To Login Page`. The
same indentation rules apply with keywords as in test cases: each unindented line is considered a new
keyword, so the implementation of the keyword need to be indented with 4 spaces.

- Add a keywords table to your test suite.
- Create a new keyword (unindented line) to your new keywords table called `Open Browser To Login Page`.
- Move `New Browser` and `New Page` keyword calls to your new keyword.
- Remove the `New Browser` and `New Page` calls in your **test case** with your new `Open Browser To Login Page` keyword.

<details>
    <summary>Your keyword table should look like this:</summary>

```robot
*** Keywords ***

Open Browser To Login Page
    New Browser    headless=${FALSE}
    New Page    http://localhost:7272
```

</details>

You can test out that your refactoring was done correctly by running `robot robot/login.robot` and
to see that test is still passing.

We can now change the rest of our test case to use our own keywords.

- Create the following keywords and move the corresponding Browser library keyword call to that keyword
    - `Enter Username`
    - `Enter Password`
    - `Submit Login Form`
    - `Verify That Welcome Page Is Visible`

*Pro-tip:* One user defined keyword can contain multiple keywords, just like a test case can have
multiple steps. This can be used to shorten test cases by hiding long chains of actions inside aptly
named keywords.

After you've defined and implemented the keywords your test case should look like this:

```robot
*** Test Cases ***

Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login
    Open Browser To Login Page
    Enter Username
    Enter Password
    Submit Login Form
    Verify That Welcome Page Is Visible
```

Ensure you refactored test is still passing by running `robot robot/login.robot`.

But hey! Doesn't our test case look nice and clean? With UTF-8 support you can write those user defined
keywords and test case names practically any language that you want: Finnish, Swedish, Russian, Traditional
Chinese, or what ever suites your project/company policy.

## Variables

Robot Framework supports [variables](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#variables).
In fact, we already used one variable in the previous exercise when made our browser open with `headless=${FALSE}`.

A benefit of using variables instead of hard coded values here and there, is to provide a single place
where to change the value, when needed, which can return all the tests that use the variable back to
working once again (if nothing else needs changing). This will increase the maintainability of the test
cases.

Let's modify our test to use variables.

### Exercise

A key aspect in using variables is discovering what values could change more often. For example, one
that is likely to change is the location (URL) where the SUT is running. In order to add variables to our
test suite, we need to create a `*** Variables ***` table.

Defining variables can be done with the following syntax:

```robot
${VARIABLE_NAME} =    variable value
```

The `=` is optional and can be removed if you don't want to use it. You still need to have two or more
(preferably at least four) spaces between `${VARIABLE_NAME}` and `variable value`.

*NOTE:* If you use `=` between the variable name and value, ensure you use **1 space at maximum** between the
variable name and `=`. Otherwise the `=` is considered to be a part of the variable value.

Variable names are completely
case-insensitive. Robot also ignores spaces and underscores (`_`). This means that in the eyes of Robot
all the following variables are treated as the same variable:
`${MYVARIABLE}`, `${MyVariable}`, `${MY VARIABLE}`, `${My_variable}`, and `${myvariable}`.
The recommended best practice is to define variables in the `*** Variables ***`
table in ALL CAPS. This is purely to help everyone better distinguish the scope of variables (use upper
case for global, suite, and test variables and lower case for keyword variables).

Let's add our `Variables` table and `URL` as a variable.

- Add a variables table into your test suite.
- Add `URL` as a variable with the value `http://localhost:7272`.
- Replace all references to `http://localhost:7272` to use your variable

<details>
    <summary>Your variable table should look like this:</summary>

```robot
*** Variables ***
${URL} =    http://localhost:7272
```

</details>

*Pro-tip:* You can combine variables with text like this `${URL}/` or `${URL}/welcome.html` without
any concatenation or arithmetic operations.

After you've made changes, run the `robot robot/login.robot` to verify that the test is still passing.

*Pro-tip:* If you don't want to actually run the test case but just check the syntax you can also run
`robot --dryrun robot/login.robot`. Check `robot -h` for more details.

Now that you've successfully changed to use `${URL}` variable, think about what other values could
change except the domain of the SUT. Create those variables and modify the test case to use them instead
of hard coded values.

- Consider what other values could be implemented as variables, add them to your variables table and
replace hard-coded values in your test case or keyword with the variable.
    - For example the credentials and/or different locators could be implemented as variables.

Once you've done those, run the `robot robot/login.robot` to verify that changes are done correctly.

## Verification

To ensure that changes are done in right manner run:

- Windows: double-click the `03-keywords_and_variables.cmd`
- Linux/macOS: run `./exercises/verify/03-keywords_and_variables.sh`

If you see `Ready to proceed!` then you're done for the exercise. Otherwise, check the output and fix, rerun.
