# Robot Syntax

In the previous exercise we created `robot/login.robot` file and the content was most likely something like this:

```
Open browser
Navigate to localhost:7272
Enter username
Enter password
Submit login form
Check that welcome page text is visible
```

If you now run command `robot robot/login.robot` you should get something like this:

`[ ERROR ] Parsing 'robot/login.robot' failed: File has no tests or tasks.`

The reason is that this is not in Robot syntax.

Check out Robot Framework user guide: http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-test-data

## Terminology

Robot files are split into parts and those parts are called tables.
Each table starts with `***` and ends with `***`.

There are 5 types of tables:

  - `*** Settings ***` - to define libraries, resources, suite/test setups, documentation etc. http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#id403
  - `*** Variables ***` - to define suite level variables http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#variable-table
  - `*** Keywords ***` - user defined keywords http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-user-keywords
  - `*** Test Cases ***` - All the suite (file) test cases goes below this one http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-case-table
  - `*** Tasks ***` - http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-tasks

Check the Robot Framework syntax guide for more details: http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-data-syntax

In order to fix the Robot output from `robot/login.robot`, let's add the missing test case table
`*** Test Cases ***` to define we have test cases in the file. This tells Robot that the file contains a test suite.

Once you've added the test case table let's run the command `robot robot/login.robot`

Using the snippet from earlier we should get output:

```
==============================================================================
Login                                                                         
==============================================================================
Open browser                                                          | FAIL |
Test case contains no keywords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigate to localhost:7272                                            | FAIL |
Test case contains no keywords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter username                                                        | FAIL |
Test case contains no keywords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter password                                                        | FAIL |
Test case contains no keywords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submit login form                                                     | FAIL |
Test case contains no keywords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check that welcome page text is visible                               | FAIL |
Test case contains no keywords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Login                                                                 | FAIL |
6 critical tests, 0 passed, 6 failed
6 tests total, 0 passed, 6 failed
```

The reason Robot thinks we have 6 test cases is because each unindented line in the `Test Cases` table is
considered as a new test case.

In order to make Robot understand that want to have 1 test case with 6 steps we need to define it like this:

```
*** Test Cases ***

Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login
```

Now in order to have the `Open browser` we need to define it under the test case and in robot that is done with 4 spaces.

Note that keywords are actually case-insensitive, so `open browser`, `OPEN BROWSER`, `Open browser`,
and `OpEn BrOwSeR` will all work. However, the recommended way is to capitalize the first letter of
each word, like `Open Browser` in this case.

```
*** Test Cases ***

Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login
    Open Browser
```

With 4 spaces at the beginning of the line indicates to robot that this keyword belongs to test case or keyword depending on the table that was defined.

Now add all missing keywords as test step to our `Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login`

After that run `robot robot/login.robot` and the output should be something like this:

```
==============================================================================
Login                                                                         
==============================================================================
Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login                 | FAIL |
No keyword with name 'Open Browser' found.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Login                                                                 | FAIL |
1 critical test, 0 passed, 1 failed
1 test total, 0 passed, 1 failed
==============================================================================
```

## Test Libraries

Robot now fails with `No keyword with name 'Open Browser' found.` but if we check the installed SeleniumLibrary documentation, we can see that there is in fact a keyword named `Open Browser`: https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html#Open%20Browser
_Why_ doesn't it show up?

This is because Robot Framework has built-in libraries that come along when you run `pip install robotframework` and
will work "out of the box" without you having to worry about anything. However, most of the needed libraries (such as
the SeleniumLibrary) are external libraries provided by the open source community and we need to tell Robot separately
to use them.

Check the library injection chapter from userguide: http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#importing-libraries

So, in order to take SeleniumLibrary into use during runtime we need to add a `*** Settings ***` table and add
the library definition there.

After `Library` you need to have _at least_ 2 spaces (preferably 4) before defining the library name:
`Library    SomeLibrary`. 

Once you've added the `Settings` table and told Robot to use SeleniumLibrary you can run `robot robot/login.robot`
again and your output should be something like this:

```
==============================================================================
Login                                                                         
==============================================================================
Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login                 | FAIL |
No keyword with name 'Navigate to localhost:7272' found.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Login                                                                 | FAIL |
1 critical test, 0 passed, 1 failed
1 test total, 0 passed, 1 failed
==============================================================================
```

So now we need to add missing arguments for `Open Browser` keyword: https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html#Open%20Browser

Our `robot/login.robot` file look now something like this (note that all words were capitalized as recommended):

```
*** Settings ***
Library    SeleniumLibrary

*** Test Cases ***

Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login
    Open Browser    http://localhost:7272    browser=gc
    Navigate To localhost:7272
    Enter Username
    Enter Password
    Submit Login Form
    Check That Welcome Page Text Is Visible
```

Pro Tip 1: If you're using Firefox and geckodriver, replace `gc` with `ff` or `firefox`.

Pro Tip 2:  Make sure that the SUT is running on it's own windows and that you can access it with address http://localhost:7272

Now when you run `robot robot/login.robot` you should see browser opening and accessing to SUT and then failing due to another keyword not found exception.

If you have something like `Navigate to localhost:7272` that can be removed since the `Open Browser` will already go to that website.

Your job now is to figure out what SeleniumLibrary keywords you can use to input username and password, and click the login element.

You need to open the source code for the web page to find the element IDs.

To verify that welcome page is visible you can check the page content, url and title.

After you've successfully run the test case with `robot robot/login.robot` you should see output like this:

```
==============================================================================
Login                                                                         
==============================================================================
Welcome Page Should Be Visible After Successful Login                 | PASS |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Login                                                                 | PASS |
1 critical test, 1 passed, 0 failed
1 test total, 1 passed, 0 failed
==============================================================================
```

After you've made the test pass, ensure that it's done with right manner by running:

  - Windows: double click `02-robot_syntax.cmd`
  - Linux/macOS: run `./02-robot_syntax.sh`

If you see `Ready to proceed!` then you're done for the exercise. Otherwise check the output and fix, rerun.
